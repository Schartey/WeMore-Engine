# Marbler
Development on Marbler has started with my 4th Semester at the Technical University Vienna. As part of the Course "Computergraphik", it 
was essential to create a game in C++ and OpenGL with at least two major effects implemented. The Game was split into an Engine and the Game itself. Development will continue after the lecture.

## Effects
Deferred Lighting
Shadow Mapping
Script - Engine (Squirrel)

## Todo
The whole project needs restructuring, a lot of implementation aspects have to be rethought, since they were added on the fly, without much time for planning. Every aspect has to become more robust.

### Planned Effects
* In-Engine Lightmap Generation
* GPU - Particle Effects (Compute Shader and Transform Feedback Fallback)
* Subdivision Surfaces
* Water Meshes
* Basics (Normal-Mapping, Bump-Mapping, Reflection, Refraction)
* Transparency
* Procedural Textures
* Video Textures
* HDR - Rendering and Tone Mapping
* Cel - Shading
* Brush - Strokes
* Lighting - Forward+
